# BonkAMon
Bonk A Mon!

Monika after story Submod! 

You get to bonk monika!

Yes, this submod has similarites to Extra+ because i used most of the codes from that, and another from Yun's OpenWorld submods.

The latest version should now be compatible with Yun's OpenWorld Submod and Extra+, Enjoy!

Just Extract and drag and drop the folder into submod folder so it should look like this

game -> Submods -> BonkAMon

You'll find the option in the Extra's button, (the one with the zoom. incase you happen to have extra+ lol)
